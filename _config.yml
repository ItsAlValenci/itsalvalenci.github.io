user_description: |
  <p>Over the past five years, I’ve worked across a variety of industries, allowing me to combine technical expertise with real-world business insight in every project. Beyond my data role, I’ve gained experience in project management, product ownership, and quality assurance, all of which have enhanced my ability to collaborate effectively across teams and approach challenges from multiple angles.</p>

  <p>I’ve found that being adaptable and comfortable with ambiguity has often been one of my strengths. I enjoy breaking down complex ideas into practical solutions that actually get used. Whether it's tackling technical problems or understanding what a team really needs to move forward, I’m focused on finding that middle ground and working collaboratively to get to the answer.</p>

  <p>Outside of work, I’ve been passionate about video games for over a decade. I volunteer as a playtester for different games and software (mostly for the fun of it), because I enjoy understanding how people interact with systems. This experience has deepened my interest in user behavior and how even small changes can completely reshape a product experience.</p>
